# DeliverX
DeliverX is developing a decentralized last-mile logistic ecosystem that enables everybody to become part of the last-mile of delivery. The DeliverX ecosystem will set up smart contracts between the sender, courier and receiver of a last-mile delivery and store them on the Ethereum blockchain. DeliverX creates an open, fair and smart logistic ecosystem that will remove the middleman from the last-mile of delivery and improve the transparency, tracking and efficiency of the current logistic industry. DeliverX will also create lots of opportunities, not only for entrepreneurs and couriers, but also for common people.
